#Rules

The main difference between Strategy poker and any other type of poker is that each player starts playing with his own deck of 52 cards, which he will be using through out the game. On each turn player makes a decision which 5 cards out of his deck he will play with in this round. Each player at the table does the same thing, and the turn starts with a round of betting just as if players were betting on the pre-flop in Texas Hold'em. Then the dealer, who is also responsible for shuffling and dealing from "casino deck", puts one card from this deck on the board openning new round of betting.
